# 		 The Pigs and Balloons Puzzle
#
# (1) All, who neither dance on tight ropes nor eat penny-buns,
#     are old.
# (2) Pigs, that are liable to giddiness, are treated with respect.
# (3) A wise balloonist takes an umbrella with him.
# (4) No one ought to lunch in public who looks ridiculous and eats
#     penny-buns.
# (5) Young creatures, who go up in balloons, are liable to 
#     giddiness.
# (6) Fat creatures, who look ridiculous, may lunch in
#     public, provided that they do not dance on tight ropes.
# (7) No wise creatures dance on tight ropes, if liable to giddiness.
# (8) A pig looks ridiculous, carrying an umbrella.
# (9) All, who do not dance on tight ropes, and who are treated
#     with respect are fat.
#
#     Show that no wise young pigs go up in balloons.
